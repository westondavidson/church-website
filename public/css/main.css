/* 
  Note: layout.css will be merged into layouts.css for better organization
  and to prevent conflicts between similar selectors across files.
  
  The files are imported in a specific order for proper cascading:
  1. Base styles (resets, typography, etc.)
  2. Layout styles (structural elements)
  3. Component styles (reusable UI elements)
  4. Page-specific styles (unique page layouts)
  5. Responsive styles (media queries, must be last)
