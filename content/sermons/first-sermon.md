In this sermon, Pastor Jane explores the journey of faith described in Hebrews 11. We learn that faith is the confidence in what we hope for and the assurance about what we do not see. Through examples of Abraham, Moses, and other biblical figures, we discover how to walk by faith in our daily lives.
